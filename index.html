              <h2>What is E-Waste?</h2>
              <p>
                E-waste refers to discarded electronic devices that are no
                longer in use, such as phones, computers, televisions, and more.
                These items can contain valuable materials like gold, silver,
                and copper, but they also include harmful substances like lead,
                mercury, and cadmium that can pose serious risks if not properly
                disposed of.
              </p>
              <p>
                As the technology industry advances, more and more electronic
                devices are being replaced, contributing to an ever-increasing
                volume of e-waste. With millions of tons of e-waste being
                generated globally every year, itâ€™s crucial to understand its
                impact on both the environment and human health.

              <h2>Why is E-Waste a Problem?</h2>
              <p>
                Improper disposal of e-waste can cause harmful chemicals like
                lead, mercury, and cadmium to pollute the environment and harm
                human health. These chemicals can leach into soil and water,
                contaminating ecosystems and food sources. In some cases, they
                can also enter the food chain through plant and animal life,
                leading to long-term damage.
              </p>
              <p>
                The growth of the e-waste problem is partly due to the lack of
                proper recycling infrastructure in many regions, along with the
                rapid pace of technological innovation that leads to devices
                becoming obsolete faster. E-waste is often discarded in
                landfills or incinerated, exacerbating the environmental damage
                and health risks.

              <h2>Recycling Process</h2>
              <p>
                Recycling e-waste involves dismantling old electronics and
                recovering valuable materials while disposing of hazardous
                substances safely. The recycling process helps conserve natural
                resources, reduces energy consumption, and limits pollution by
                reusing materials like metals, plastics, and glass.
              </p>
              <p>
                The process typically starts with the manual or mechanical
                separation of components, followed by shredding and sorting the
                materials. Advanced techniques like smelting, refining, and
                chemical processing are then used to recover precious metals.
                Proper recycling also prevents toxic substances from leaching
                into the environment.
              </p>

              <h2>Global E-Waste Statistics</h2>
              <p>
                Over 50 million metric tons of e-waste are generated each year,
                but only about 20% is recycled properly. The rest is either
                disposed of in landfills or shipped to developing countries,
                where recycling practices are often inadequate or unsafe.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the United States alone, nearly 150 million mobile phones are
                discarded each year, contributing to a growing global crisis.
                The lack of awareness and access to proper e-waste recycling
                programs continues to hinder efforts to reduce the negative
                impacts of electronic waste.

              <h2>Health Risks</h2>
              <p>
                Exposure to toxic e-waste chemicals can lead to serious health
                issues, including neurological damage, cancer, and organ
                failure. Workers in informal e-waste recycling facilities,
                especially in developing countries, are at risk due to their
                direct exposure to hazardous materials without proper protective
                gear.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ingestion of or contact with lead, mercury, and cadmium, among
                other toxins, can affect brain development in children, cause
                kidney and liver damage, and result in respiratory issues.
                Long-term exposure can lead to chronic illnesses such as cancer
                and heart disease. Proper disposal and recycling are essential
                to minimizing these risks.

          <h3>What is e-waste recycling, and why is it important?</h3>
          <p>
            E-waste recycling is the process of recovering valuable materials
            from old electronics while safely disposing of harmful substances.
            It's important because it reduces pollution, conserves resources,
            and prevents harmful toxins from leaching into the environment.
          </p>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Can I recycle batteries with e-waste?</h3>
          <p>
            Many types of batteries, such as lithium-ion, lead-acid, and
            nickel-cadmium, can be recycled along with e-waste. However, some
            batteries require separate recycling due to their hazardous nature.
            Always check with your local center for specific instructions.
